lets create my slideshow with python, with a 'q' as a way to exit, looping indefinitely and adding any new images as they may get copied.

create the prime number python program that Gloria asked about before I start. then in time I could iterate it to use multiple threads, 
    first create the program from logic and loops
    second create the program with any available pip libraries or packages available

how do I search what is available in pip?

how do I find the documentaion and usage instructions (like man) for any given library/package?

how do I get my git directory caught up so that it is the same as GH (and vice versa)
